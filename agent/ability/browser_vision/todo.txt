Consent handling
Only checks a fixed list of button texts; may miss regional or custom dialogs.
Improvement: Add more texts, support iframes by URL pattern, or use a short timeout so slow consent doesn’t block the capture.

No image understanding
Only text is summarized; screenshot is stored but not analyzed.
Improvement: Optional vision model (e.g. GPT-4V, Gemini) to describe images when needed.

No user intent
Same behavior for all URLs.
Improvement: Optional params like scroll_to_bottom, wait_for_selector, or extract_links to adapt behavior.

Content extraction
.text can miss content in iframes, shadow DOM, or dynamic content.
Improvement: Extract from iframes, or use a more robust extraction method (e.g. readability-style).

Single output filename
Always overwrites browser_vision.*, so multiple URLs in one run overwrite each other.
